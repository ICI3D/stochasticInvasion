## Simulate a disease spreading generation by generation
## Ignore:
#### Time (just count generations)
#### Total population size (just count infected individuals)
####### This means we're assuming we can neglect the susceptibles going down
#### ICI3D perspective (we're just going to use the Lloyd-Smith perspective)
## Assume: process does not change through time

## LS say (correctly) that a simple ODE model corresponds to an exponential distribution of infectiousness: this is because recovery is modeled as a random [constant ?? ? exponentially distributed Duration]
## kappa is CV? (unitless and equal to 1/a, where a is a standard shape parameter)
