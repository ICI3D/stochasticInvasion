How does host heterogeneity affect the probability that a disease will establish in a population?

JD claims that it can either increase or decrease the probability; how could that be?
* The difference may well be driven by implicit and explicit correlations

If we are asking about the effects of heterogeneity alone, what should we hold constant?

Who is interested in: math, simulation, literature review, specific examples (populations or diseases or both)?

Do we have to worry about the effects of model structure
* very simple model?
* many different models?

### Types of heterogeneity

We can have heterogeneity in
* β (transmission rate)
	* contact rate (do we want to assume that infection affects this?)
	* probability of infection
* D (duration of infectiousness)
* σ (susceptibility)
* correlations

Through time
* clinical immunity to malaria

Asymptomatic vs. symptomatic
* Who spreads, who seeks treatment…

Super-spreaders (Lloyd-Smith)
* Focus on how many people an infected individual will infect
	* includes β and p
	* excludes σ (important if more susceptible people have different infection properties)
	* what about c?
		* this framework does not address the possiblity that c correlates between susceptible and infectious state
* Could super-spreaders just spread longer?

Highly active people (ICI3D)
* what about heterogeneity in mobility?
