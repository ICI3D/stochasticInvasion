## Questions

How does host heterogeneity affect the probability that a disease will establish in a population?

JD claims that it can either increase or decrease the probability; how could that be?

If we are asking about the effects of heterogeneity alone, what should we hold constant?

### Types of heterogeneity

Through time
* clinical immunity to malaria

Asymptomatic vs. symptomatic
* Who spreads, who seeks treatmentâ€¦

Super-spreaders (Lloyd-Smith)

Highly active people (ICI3D)
* what about heterogeneity in mobility?
