## Questions

How does host heterogeneity affect the probability that a disease will establish in a population?

JD claims that it can either increase or decrease the probability; how could that be?
* The difference may well be driven by implicit and explicit correlations

If we are asking about the effects of heterogeneity alone, what should we hold constant?

Who is interested in: math, simulation, literature review, specific examples (populations or diseases or both)?

Do we have to worry about the effects of model structure
* very simple model?
* many different models?

### Types of heterogeneity

We can have heterogeneity in
* β (transmission rate)
	* contact rate (do we want to assume that infection affects this?)
	* probability of infection
* D (duration of infectiousness)
* σ (susceptibility)
* correlations

Through time
* clinical immunity to malaria

Asymptomatic vs. symptomatic
* Who spreads, who seeks treatment…

Super-spreaders (Lloyd-Smith)
* Focus on how many people an infected individual will infect
	* includes β and p
	* excludes σ (important if more susceptible people have different infection properties)
	* what about c?
		* this framework does not address the possiblity that c correlates between susceptible and infectious state
* Could super-spreaders just spread longer?

Highly active people (ICI3D)
* what about heterogeneity in mobility?

* Lack of to health care may provide the disease to sustain longer duration, because intervention is yet to reach the infected to reduce the transmission of the disease. This should be considered different from the Highly active group of people, as this highly active people are characterized by their behavior, and their inability to adhere to the protocols of intervention available for the control of the disease, where the people of no access to healthcare are simple carrying the disease because of the lack of facility.
